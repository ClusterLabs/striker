DESCRIPTION

#!string!scancore_brand_0001!# is the heart of the #!string!brand_0004!# Intelligent Availability Platform.

#!string!scancore_brand_0001!# runs as a daemon, looping every #!data!scancore::sleep_time!# seconds. On each loop, 
it invokes all of the agents it finds under #!data!path::agents_directory!#. 

Each agent, in turn, runs largely autonomously. Most agents will check to see 
if their target devices/software is not available without actually doing 
anything. For agents that do find something to scan, they will first verify 
that the database has their schema and initialize each database as needed. 
Next, each agent will do a quick check to consolidate data and add missing 
records to each database, if needed, to ensure all databases are in sync.

With the DBs prepared, the agent will scan the device(s) and/or software they
were designed for. At the end of the scan, they will compare current values 
against previous values as well as check current values against static 
thresholds and limits. They will use this data to issue alerts, as needed, and
to take precautionary, recovery or other actions as they deem appropriate.

Alerts from agents are fed into a special DB table. Certain special values, 
like UPS power data and thermal sensor data, can also be recorded in special
tables. At this point, the agent exits and the next agent is invoked.

After all agents are invoked, #!string!scancore_brand_0001!# will process alerts and send out emails
and/or add log files entries. This insures that a minimal number of alerts are
dispatched. This process handles localization, allowing for different 
recipients to receive alerts in their preferred language and units. 

Next, #!string!scancore_brand_0001!# will examine the special power and thermal tables. This data 
will be used by #!string!scancore_brand_0001!# to decided if, for example, multiple agents reported 
high temperatures that the room the equipment is in is overheating and initiate
load shedding, emergency shut down or server relocation. On #!string!brand_0002!# machines,
as another example, #!string!scancore_brand_0001!# can determine, if #!string!brand_0004!# nodes are offline,
whether power and temperature is safe and, if so, will boot the nodes back up.


SWITCHES

 --clear-resync-flag

	When a node or dashboard needs to resync the ScanCore database, it will
	set a flag telling other instance to please pause. If that machine 
	errors out or crashes, the flag can be left which blocks ScanCore until
	the lock expires. This command will clear that flag.

 --disable

	This will disable #!string!scancore_brand_0001!# at the completion of the current scan loop
	(or at the end of the current sleep). 

 --enable

	This will enable #!string!scancore_brand_0001!#. It will start within one minute of this 
	command being issued.

 --force

	This will force #!string!scancore_brand_0001!# to run, even when it has been disabled or if
	another instance is running.

 --state, --status

	This will print out whether or not #!string!scancore_brand_0001!# is enabled and/or running.
