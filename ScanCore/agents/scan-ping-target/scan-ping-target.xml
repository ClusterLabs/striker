 -=] Ping Target Scan Agent

DESCRIPTION

This program is a "scan agent" for the ScanCore decision engine tool for the
Anvil! high-availabiltiy platform.

It checks to see if a target machine can be pinged. The target can be any 
machine; Dashboards, nodes, hosted servers or any machine outside the Anvil! 
system. 

This agent will only run if one or more targets are specifically configured in
striker.conf. 

Configuration is to add the following to striker.conf;

====
scan-ping-target::target::<id>::host     = <name_or_ip>
scan-ping-target::target::<id>::count    = #
====

The <id> can be any alpha-numeric string or number that is unique from other 
entries. Any number of entries can be added, but the checks will be performed
sequentially. So in a case where multiple targets are slow to respond, this 
agent could run for some time.

The 'host' can be an IP address or a resolvable host name. Optionally, you can
specify how many pings are sent in a given check. The default is to ping 3 
times (with a 1 second pause between pings). Pings timeout after 1 second, so
targets with very high latency may be reported as 'offline' when they aren't.


NOTE:

Pinging a target to check access has limited use. When possible to use, using
'scan-remote-access' is a better to verify if a target is online. Pings are 
less reliable because some machines ignore ICMP ping packets and will always
appear offline, or a target is behind a firewall which replies to pings, 
regardless of the availability of the target behind it. It is also possible 
that a machine can be "alive enough" to respond to pings while not actually
be working.

If you use this agent, please consider these limitations before hand.


SWITCHES


 -h, -?, --help

	Show this dialog and exit.

 --prep-db

	If passed, the schema will be loaded into the database (if not 
	already), even if no bonds are found. Note: This won't work if the 
	agent has been manually disabled via 'scan-ipmitool::disable'.
