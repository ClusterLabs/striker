-=] ScanCore - Agent - scan-server-resources

DESCRIPTION

This agent tries to read the resources on a server. Optionally, it can be 
configured to reboot a server if it stops reporting resource data for a set
period of time.

This agent will only run if one or more targets are specifically configured in
striker.conf. 

Configuration is to add the following to striker.conf;

====
scan-server-resources::target::<id>::host		= <name_or_ip>{:<port>}
scan-server-resources::target::<id>::reboot_timer	= #
====

The <id> can be any alpha-numeric string or number that is unique from other 
entries. Any number of entries can be added, but the checks will be performed
sequentially. So in a case where multiple targets are slow to respond, this 
agent could run for some time.

The 'host' can be an IP address or a resolvable host name. Optionally, a port
can be specified with the suffix '<name_or_ip>:<port>'. The default port is
#!data!scan-server-resources::an-ssrw-port!#.

Optionally, you can set a reboot timer. If the target is hosted on the node
trying to scan it, and if the target stops responding to calls for more than
'reboot_timer' seconds, the server will be rebooted. When this is set to '0',
the default, the server will never be reset.

WARNING:

We can't tell the difference between a crashed server and a crashed daemon.
Please only enable the 'reboot_timer' feature after careful consideration.


SWITCHES


 -h, -?, --help

	Show this dialog and exit.

 --prep-db

	If passed, the schema will be loaded into the database (if not 
	already), even if no bonds are found. Note: This won't work if the 
	agent has been manually disabled via 'scan-ipmitool::disable'.
