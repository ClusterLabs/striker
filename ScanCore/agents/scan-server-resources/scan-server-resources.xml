-=] ScanCore - Agent - scan-server-resources

DESCRIPTION

This agent tries to read the resources on a server.

This agent will only run if one or more targets are specifically configured in
striker.conf. 

Configuration is to add the following to striker.conf;

====
scan-server-resources::target::<id>::host		= <name_or_ip>{:<port>}
====

The <id> can be any alpha-numeric string or number that is unique from other 
entries. Any number of entries can be added, but the checks will be performed
sequentially. So in a case where multiple targets are slow to respond, this 
agent could run for some time.

The 'host' can be an IP address or a resolvable host name. Optionally, a port
can be specified with the suffix '<name_or_ip>:<port>'. The default port is
#!data!scan-server-resources::an-ssrw-port!#.


SWITCHES


 -h, -?, --help

	Show this dialog and exit.

 --prep-db

	If passed, the schema will be loaded into the database (if not 
	already), even if no bonds are found. Note: This won't work if the 
	agent has been manually disabled via 'scan-ipmitool::disable'.
