 -=] IPMI Scan Agent

DESCRIPTION

This program is a "scan agent" for the ScanCore alert, monitoring and recovery
tool for the Anvil! Intelligent Availabilityâ„¢ platform.

It monitors health of systems using tools locally available on most systems. 
Examples including information about memory available via /proc/meminfo and
dmidecode, CPU data available via /proc/cpuinfo, etc.

SWITCHES


 -h, -?, --help

	Show this dialog and exit.

 --prep-db

	If passed, the schema will be loaded into the database (if not 
	already), even if no bonds are found. Note: This won't work if the 
	agent has been manually disabled via 'scan-ipmitool::disable'.
