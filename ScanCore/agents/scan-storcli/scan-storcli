# Exit Codes:

# 2  - storcli64 is installed but it is not executable.
# 3  - No LSI-based controllers found.
# 4  - Got data from the wrong controller.
# 5  - Unexpecte status when querying adapter

# 7  - Failed to match a BBU to a host controller's serial number.
# 8  - Failed to match a controller's serial number to a controller UUID.
# 9  - Failed to match a Cachevault to a host controller's serial number.
# 10 - Failed to match a virtual drive ID string to a host controller's serial number.
# 11 - Failed to match a drive group ID string to a host controller's serial number.
# 12 - Failed to get the controller serial number that a physical drive is connected to.
# 13 - Failed to get the serial number of a physical drive.
# 14 - Drive group UUID doesn't exist when it should have.
# 15 - Controller serial number for an existing drive group wasn't found.
# 16 - Non-numeric value in numeric virtual drive variable.
# 
# 255 - The host's UUID isn't in the hosts table yet, ScanCore itself hasn't been run.
# 
# TODO:
# - Check the cache policy and reset it to 'writeback' if the BBU/FBU is healthy and the cache changes to 
#   write-through.
# - When two or more drives have errors, 'drive:other_error_count' is only set to '1'. It should be the 
#   number of drives with errors. Also, if the error on one drive got above 100, its weight should be '2' and
#   above 1000, set to '3'.
# 
# NOTE:
# - LSI seems to flip between "Virtual Drive" and "Virtual Disk". We're standardizing on "Virtual Drive".

		# T10-PI (T10 working group, Protection Information) has three levels (Taken from the Seagate
		# PDF listed below):
		# Type 0 - Describes a drive that is not formatted with PI information bytes. This allows 
		#          for legacy support in non-PI systems.
		# Type 1 - Provides support of PI protection using 10- and 16-byte commands. The RDPROTECT
		#          and WRTPROTECT bits allow for checking control through the CDB. Eight bytes of
		#          Protection Information are transmitted at sector boundaries across the interface 
		#          if RDPROTECT and WRTPROTECT bits are non-zero values. Type I does not allow the 
		#          use of 32-byte commands.
		# Type 2 - Provides checking control and additional expected fields within the 32-byte CDBs. 
		#          Eight bytes of Protection Information are transmitted at sector boundaries across 
		#          the interface if RDPROTECT and WRTPROTECT bits are non-zero values. Type II does 
		#          allow the use of 10- and 16-byte commands with zero values in the RDPROTECT and 
		#          WRTPROTECT fields. The drive will generate a dummy (for example, 0xFFFF) eight 
		#          bytes of Protection Information in the media, but these eight bytes will not be 
		#          transferred to the host during read.
		# Type 3 - ? (GUARD tag, reference tag and app tag are combined)
		#          - http://www.snia.org/sites/default/education/tutorials/2008/fall/storage/RichardVanderbilt_Why_Data_Integrity_rev2.pdf
		#          Protection is enabled and the 32-byte commands are not valid. The Reference Tag is
		#          not defined and may be used as an extension of the Application Tag. The drive will
		#          not check the Reference Tag. 
		#          - https://www.hgst.com/sites/default/files/resources/End-to-end_Data_Protection.pdf
		#          Type 3 does not define the ref tag.
