 -=] IPMI Scan Agent

DESCRIPTION

This program is a "scan agent" for the ScanCore alert, monitoring and recovery
tool for the Anvil! high-availabiltiy platform.

It monitors health of LSI-based RAID controllers using the 'storcli64' command
line tool. 

On Anvil! nodes, the thermal information returned by the controller, BBU/FBU 
and individual physical drives will be used by ScanCore to help determine when
a node is getting dangerously hot. This information (along with thermal sensor
data from other scan agents) will be used to decide when a node needs to be 
powered down to avoid a dangerous over-temperature excursion.

		These keys convert the often-cryptic control details into plain-language strings. The key 
		word matches the ScanCore database column name. Each entry has four prefixes;
		     'name_' Is the straight name for the entry
		     'info_' Is a short summary of the entry
		     'long_' Is a longer explanation of the entry.
		     'link_' Is an optional URL to further explain the entry.
		
		In some cases, a variable will have a preset number of values. In those cases, the keys will
		be in the format:
		     'state_<db_column_name>_<state>'
		In these cases, the 'state' is the string returned by storcli, made lower case, with '_' in
		the place of spaces. For example;
		     'state_storcli_status_controller_status_needs_attention' 
		Is the 'Needs Attention' state for the 'storcli_status_controller_status' database column. 
		This provides a predictable mechanism for translating a variable's state information into the
		chosen language without needing to manuall map a state sequence number to a particular 
		variable, though it admittedly does create very long key names.
