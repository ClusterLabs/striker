 -=] Broadcom (LSI/Avago) RAID Controller Scan Agent

DESCRIPTION

This program is a "scan agent" for the ScanCore alert, monitoring and recovery
tool for the Anvil! high-availabiltiy platform.

It monitors health of LSI-based RAID controllers using the 'storcli64' command
line tool. 

On Anvil! nodes, the thermal information returned by the controller, BBU/FBU 
and individual physical drives will be used by ScanCore to help determine when
a node is getting dangerously hot. This information (along with thermal sensor
data from other scan agents) will be used to decide when a node needs to be 
powered down to avoid a dangerous over-temperature excursion.
