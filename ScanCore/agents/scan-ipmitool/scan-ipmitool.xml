 -=] IPMI Scan Agent

DESCRIPTION

This program is a "scan agent" for the ScanCore alert, monitoring and recovery
tool for the Anvil! high-availabiltiy platform.

It monitors health of nodes (and IPMI-equiped Striker dashboards) using the
'ipmitool' program. It uses the IPMI's network connection to monitor machines.

On Anvil! nodes, the thermal information will be used by ScanCore to determine
when a node is getting dangerously hot. This information (along with thermal 
sensor data from other scan agents) will be used to decide when a node needs to
be powered down to avoid a dangerous over-temperature excursion.

On Striker dashboards, this agent will provide up to date thermal information
to ScanCore to allow it to determine when a node that has gone into 
emergency-stop can be safely rebooted.
