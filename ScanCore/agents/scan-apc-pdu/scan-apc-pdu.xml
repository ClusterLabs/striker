 -=] APC UPS Scan Agent

DESCRIPTION

This program is a "scan agent" for the ScanCore decision engine, part of the
Anvil! Intelligent-availabiltiyâ„¢ system.

It monitors APC/Schneider brand network-connected switched PDUs.


SWITCHES


 -h, -?, --help

	Show this dialog and exit.

 --prep-db

	If passed, the schema will be loaded into the database (if not 
	already), even if no APC brand UPSes are found. Note: This won't work
	if the agent has been manually disabled via 'scan-apc-pdu::disable'.

 --pdus <pdu1>[,<pdu2>,...,<pduN>]

	Specify the PDU(s) to query. If host names are used, they must be 
	convertable to IP addresses. Two or more PDUs can be defined using
	commas and *no* spaces to separate them.
	
	This is optional. By default, the scan agent will read /etc/hosts and
	any entries with a host name containing 'pdu' will be checked. If you
	are not using /etc/hosts, then be sure to set:
	
	scancore::agent::scan-apc-pdu::switches::pdu = <pdu1>[,<pdu2>,...,<pduN>]
	
	This will tell ScanCore to call this agent using this switch.
