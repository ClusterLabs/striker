 -=] ScanCore - Agent - scan-clustat

DESCRIPTION

This agent reads and parses the output from rgmanager's 'clustat' (Cluster
Status) program. It will detect changes in VMs, storage, libvirtd services and
nodes joining, leaving and recovering.


SWITCHES

 -c <host>, --caller <host>
	
	This is to be set by the ScanCore server and 'host' must match the
	FQDN of the caller. When data is recorded to the target databases, this
	value is used to link the data to this host. Failing to match this name
	to an entry in the 'hosts' table will cause the agent to exit with the
	return code of '1'.


 -h, -?, --help

	Show this dialog and exit.
