 -=] IPMI Scan Agent

DESCRIPTION

This program is a "scan agent" for the ScanCore decision engine tool for the
Anvil! high-availabiltiy platform.

It checks to see if a target machine can be accessed over SSH. The target can 
be any machine that supports SSH access; Dashboards, nodes, hosted servers or
any machine outside the Anvil! system. 

It works by ssh'ing into the target and calling 'echo 1'. If '1' is returned,
we know access was successful. Unlike pings, this method is more reliable as
pings alone could be responded to by a firewall or router. Alternatively, some
machines ignore ICMP ping packets, even when online.

This agent will only run if one or more targets are specifically configured in
striker.conf. 

Configuration is to add the following to striker.conf;

====
scan-remote-access::target::<id>::host     = <user>@<name_or_ip>:<port>
scan-remote-access::target::<id>::password = <secret>
====

The <id> can be any alpha-numeric string or number that is unique from other 
entries. Any number of entries can be added, but the checks will be performed
sequentially. So in a case where multiple targets are slow to respond, this 
agent could run for some time.

The 'host' can be an IP address or a resolvable host name. Optionally, you can
specify ':xx' to specify a non-standard port to use for SSH. When no suffix is
used, port 22 is used.

The 'host' can, optionally, have a user to connect as. When not specified, the
'root' user is used.

SWITCHES


 -h, -?, --help

	Show this dialog and exit.

 --prep-db

	If passed, the schema will be loaded into the database (if not 
	already), even if no bonds are found. Note: This won't work if the 
	agent has been manually disabled via 'scan-ipmitool::disable'.
