 -=] APC UPS Scan Agent

DESCRIPTION

This program is a "scan agent" for the ScanCore alert, monitoring and recovery
tool for the Anvil! high-availabiltiy platform.

It monitors APC/Schneider brand UPSes. When run on Anvil! nodes, it will
gracefully shut down all servers, withdraw the nodes from the cluster stack and
power the node down when the UPSes powering the node are running on batteries
and the estimated runtime drops below a critical level.

When run on Striker dashboards, it will provide up to date information on the
health of APC brand UPSes so that ScanCore can determine when it is safe to
restart nodes that have gone into emergency-stop. 


SWITCHES

 -upses <ups1>[,<ups2>,...,<upsN>]

	Specify the UPS(es) to query. If host names are used, they must be 
	convertable to IP addresses. Two or more UPSes can be defined using
	commas and *no* spaces to separate them.
	
	This is optional. By default, the scan agent will read /etc/hosts and
	any entries with a host name containing 'ups' will be checked. If you
	are not using /etc/hosts, then be sure to set:
	
	scancore::agent::scan-apc-ups::switches::ups = <ups1>[,<ups2>,...,<upsN>]
	
	This will tell ScanCore to call this agent using this switch.
