 -=] Striker installer

DESCRIPTION

This program installs and configures Striker, the Anvil! dashboard, on an
almost minimal EL6 install.


SWITCHES

 -upses <ups1>[,<ups2>,...,<upsN>]

	Specify the UPS(es) to query. If host names are used, they must be 
	convertable to IP addresses. Two or more UPSes can be defined using
	commas and *no* spaces to separate them.
	
	This is optional. By default, the scan agent will read /etc/hosts and
	any entries with a host name containing 'ups' will be checked. If you
	are not using /etc/hosts, then be sure to set:
	
	scancore::agent::scan-apc-ups::switches::ups = <ups1>[,<ups2>,...,<upsN>]
	
	This will tell ScanCore to call this agent using this switch.


 -h, -?, --help

	Show this dialog and exit.
