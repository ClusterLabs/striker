If, for some reason, you need to redefine the server you should disabled scan-server by setting:
- [scan-server::disable = 1]
In this node's: [#!data!path::striker_config!#] configuration file. Once disabled, you can 
redefine the server with the following command;
- [virsh define #!variable!backup!#]
Once you have added the server to the Anvil!, you can re-enable this scan agent by undoing the
change you made to striker.conf.

		<key name="scan_server_message_0024">
The server: [#!variable!server_name!#] was stuck in a paused state, which should never happen.
If this happened immediately after the server booted, then there should be no problems.
If the server had been operating, you may need to check the consistency of the filesystems, databases or similar.
A force-off was performed after a 'resume' failed.
The server should be restarted by the Anvil! momentarily.
