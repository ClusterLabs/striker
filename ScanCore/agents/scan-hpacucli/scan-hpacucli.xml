 -=] Broadcom (LSI/Avago) RAID Controller Scan Agent

DESCRIPTION

This program is a "scan agent" for the ScanCore alert, monitoring and recovery
tool for the Anvil! Intelligent Availabilityâ„¢ platform.

It monitors health of HPE-type RAID controllers using the HP Array 
Configuration Utility CLI 'hpacucli' command line tool. 

On Anvil! nodes, the thermal information returned by the controller, BBU/FBU 
and individual physical drives will be used by ScanCore to help determine when
a node is getting dangerously hot. This information (along with thermal sensor
data from other scan agents) will be used to decide when a node needs to be 
powered down to avoid a dangerous over-temperature excursion.


SWITCHES


 -h, -?, --help

	Show this dialog and exit.

 --prep-db

	If passed, the schema will be loaded into the database (if not 
	already), even if no controllers are found. Note: This won't work if 
	the agent has been manually disabled via 'scan-hpacucli::disable'.
