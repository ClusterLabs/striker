[Anvil!](https://www.alteeve.com/w/Anvil!) m2 - [Striker](https://www.alteeve.com/w/Striker) + [ScanCore](https://www.alteeve.com/w/ScanCore) v2.0.0
=============

Welcome to the v2.0.0 release of the *Anvil!* m2 [Intelligent Availability](https://www.alteeve.com/w/Intelligent_Availability)â„¢ platform! 

What is an *Anvil!* Platform?

* It is the first server platform designed with the singular focus of protecting your servers and keeping them running under even extreme fault conditions. 
* It is fully self-contained, making it ideal for totally offline operation.
* It is a "self driving" server availability platform that can continuously monitors internal and external data sources, compiling, analyzing and autonomously deciding when and what action to take to protect your servers. It is ideally suited for extended remote deployments and "hands off" operation.
* It is based of an extensively field tested, open architecture with full data, mechanical and electrical redundancy allowing any component to be failed, removed and replaced without the need for a maintenance window.
* It is extremely easy to use, minimizing the opportunity for human error and making it possible for "remote hands" to affect repairs without any prior availability experience and minimal technical knowledge.

In short, it is a server platform that just won't die.

The *Anvil!* was designed and extensively tested on [Primergy](http://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/servers/primergy/) servers, Brocade [ICX](http://www.brocade.com/en/products-services/switches/campus-network-switches.html) switches and APC [SmartUPS](http://www.apc.com/smartups/index.cfm?ISOCountryCode=ca) UPSes and [Switched PDU](http://www.apc.com/shop/ca/en/categories/power-distribution/rack-power-distribution/switched-rack-pdu/_/N-17k76am)s. That said, the *Anvil!* platform is designed to be hardware agnostic and should work just fine on Dell, Cisco USC, NEC, Lenovo x-series, and other tier-1 server vendors. 

[Alteeve](https://www.alteeve.com/), the company behind the *Anvil!* project, actively supports the [open source](https://www.alteeve.com/w/Support) community. We also offer commercial support contracts to assist with any stage of deployment, operation and custom development.
