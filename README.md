Striker v2.0.0 - alpha
=============

  Striker is the user interface for the Anvil! (virtual) server platform and
the ScanCore autonomous self-defence and alert system. 

  Version 1.1.6 is the last stable release, and it is fairly out of date. 
After well over a year of work, we're getting close to the v2 beta release.
Intrepid sysadmins are invited to joing us in final testing of the current 
alpha version.

Online Documentation
--------------------

  The core of the Anvil! platform, designed to be able to run entirely alone
and fully supported by Red Hat. It does not include the Striker interface or
ScanCore ASDAS system. Adding those converts the HA stack into a full Anvil!.
