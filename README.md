Striker v2.0.0 - beta
=============

  Striker is the user interface for the Anvil! "Intelligent Availability(tm)"
platform. It includes 'ScanCore' and associated agents which provide the
ever-growing intelligence that makes the Anvil! the next-generation of high
availability server platforms.

  Version 2.0.0 is now in beta!

  Anyone interested in testing out the new system is welcome to contact us. We
will be happy to help users get their Anvil! systems up and running in exchange
for helping us refine and stabilize the platform. Once Striker hits final 
release, all beta participants will be eligable for 3 months of 24x7 monitoring
by Alteeve, as our thank you for helping us make Striker even better.

Online Documentation
--------------------

  A core component of the beta to final transition will be the completion of
the associated documentation. The new documentation is still being worked on,
but you can read what exists so far here.
