  curl https://alteeve.ca/repo/el6/an.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/an.repo
  yum clean all; yum install perl-Net-SSH2

- AN!CDB now updated /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/hosts. Please be sure that
  apache can edit these if you want to use the new WebUI configuration tool.

- Added port support in an.conf (node1:port, node2:port) in addition to
  /etc/ssh/ssh_config
