Change log;

v1.1.5 - <in progress>
- Fixed some undefined replacement string errors in the server details entry
  for servers not yet added to the Anvil!.
- Disabled the 'Delete' button for a server when it has not yet been added to
  the Anvil!.
- Fixed a variable substitution name in 'message_0211'.
- Made the error displayed when a server fails to be added to the Anvil!
  because of a missing failover domain entry in cluster.conf.
- Added, but commented out, 'no_kill="1"' to new VM services in rgmanager to
  prevent force-off of servers that are slow to boot. This will be enabled as
  soon as resource-agents is updated.
  (as per: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1079032)
- Removed the confirmation requirements for several fairly-safe commands, line
  powering on nodes, booting servers, etc.
- Updated the IPMI scanner code to redirect sensor loss/restore messages to a
  now-smarter debug email address.
- Made all buttons and images come from skins


v1.1.4 - 2014-05-27
- Added the 'gather-system-info' (and associated setuid script).
- Fixed a bug with saving the guacamole port definition.


v1.1.3 - 2014-05-25
- Added support for backing up and restoring the Striker configuration.
- Fixed the back and refresh buttons in the management pages.
- Moved the configuration 'Save' and 'Push/Backup' buttons further apart to
  reduce the change of accidentally clicking the wrong button.
  

v1.1.2 - 2014-05-23
- Added 'Test::Harness' to the installers.
- Fixed a text substitution error on the header box when inserting media into
  a server's optical drive.
- Added support for software (md) RAID arrays in AN!CM.


v1.1.1 - 2014-05-20
- Added support for pushing changed configs to Anvil!s via the dashboard.
- Updated an-cm to use per-Anvil! override values.
- Updated an-cm logging to print human-readable times instead of unix
  timestamps.


v1.1.0 - 2014-05-04
- NOTE: This is a major release. The instructions below should allow for an
        in-place update, but a reinstall is recommended.
        
- Passwordless SSH is no longer required. Switched to using the Net::SSH2 perl
  module.
- New AN! Repo created. Please run:
  ----
  curl https://alteeve.ca/repo/el6/an.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/an.repo
  yum clean all;
  yum install perl-Net-SSH2 perl-TermReadKey expect
  ----
- AN!CDB now updated /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/hosts. Please be sure that
  apache can edit these if you want to use the new WebUI configuration tool.
  Please run:
  ----
  chown root:apache /etc/ssh/ssh_config /etc/hosts
  chmod g+w /etc/ssh/ssh_config /etc/hosts
  ----
- Cache and archive files are now stored in dedicated directories. If you are
  updating, please run:
  ----
  mkdir /var/www/home/archive
  mkdir /var/www/home/cache
  chown -R apache:apache /var/www/home
  mv /var/www/home/cache_* /var/www/home/cache/
  mv /var/www/home/an.conf* /var/www/home/archive/
  mv /var/www/home/ssh_config* /var/www/home/archive/
  mv /var/www/home/hosts* /var/www/home/archive/
  ----
- Added port support in an.conf (node1:port, node2:port) in addition to
  /etc/ssh/ssh_config
- Added new variable for 'cluster::X::root_pw' if the root password is
  different from the ricci password. When not defined, the ricci password will
  be used.
- Changed the WebUI configuration to now uses separate pages for configuring a
  given Anvil!. Added support for per-anvil! overrides of global email values,
  though support for this has not yet been added to the alert monitor.
- Log data is flushed to disk before exiting record().
- Changed the 'lvcreate' calls to use Gibibytes instead of Megabytes.
- Switch an-cm to use the common an-cdb.log file.
- Bumped up the apache Timeout to a rather high number to prevent sessions
  closing during large uploads.
- Now cache /etc/hosts from each node and updated 'on_same_network()' to use
  the cached hosts data when local resolution fails. This allows things like
  powering on a node to work without editing the dashboard's local hosts file.
- Modified how reserved RAM for the host is calculated. To ensure that the user
  always sees and even number of GiB, the reserved amount is set to an even
  number of GiB, 3 currently, the modulous is calculated on the available RAM,
  and then the available RAM is calculated as
  (total ram - modulous - reserved).
- When a node's DRBD disk state is 'Inconsistent' and the resync percentage was
  read successfully, the percentage complete is shown.
- Trying to upload a file without defining a file now throws a proper error
  message.
- All printed text is now pulled from an XML file and processed by a new 
  'get_string()' to enable future translations.
- All browser formatting has been moved into a new templating system processed
  by the new 'template' function for future skinning.
- Changed the node control to disable 'Fence Node' when a node is already off.
- Lots of miscellaneous formatting and text cleanup.
- Started the process of renaming AN!CDB to Striker and changing the terms
  'cluster' to 'Anvil!' and 'VM' to 'Server'.
- Now use 'expect' to enable password-based rsyncs from Striker to nodes when
  'expect' is installed. If it is not installed, direct rsync is used, though
  passwordless SSH is then required.
- Moved the location of generated ISOs from the 'media' directory to '/tmp'.
- LSI controller now supports clearing foreign states from disks.
