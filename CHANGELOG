v1.0.4 - <in-progress>
- Major: Passwordless SSH is no longer required. Switched to using the 
  Net::SSH2 perl module.
- New AN! Repo created. Please run:
  ----
  curl https://alteeve.ca/repo/el6/an.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/an.repo
  yum clean all;
  yum install perl-Net-SSH2 perl-TermReadKey
  ----
- AN!CDB now updated /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/hosts. Please be sure that
  apache can edit these if you want to use the new WebUI configuration tool.
  Please run:
  ----
  chown root:apache /etc/ssh/ssh_config /etc/hosts
  chmod g+w /etc/ssh/ssh_config /etc/hosts
  ----
- Cache and archive files are now stored in dedicated directories. If you are
  updating, please run:
  ----
  mkdir /var/www/home/archive
  mkdir /var/www/home/cache
  chown -R apache:apache /var/www/home
  mv /var/www/home/cache_* /var/www/home/cache/
  mv /var/www/home/an.conf* /var/www/home/archive/
  mv /var/www/home/ssh_config* /var/www/home/archive/
  mv /var/www/home/hosts* /var/www/home/archive/
  ----
- Added port support in an.conf (node1:port, node2:port) in addition to
  /etc/ssh/ssh_config
- Added new variable for 'cluster::X::root_pw' if the root password is
  different from the ricci password. When not defined, the ricci password will
  be used.
- Changed the WebUI configuration to now uses separate pages for configuring a
  given Anvil!. Added support for per-anvil! overrides of global email values,
  though support for this has not yet been added to the alert monitor.
- Log data is flushed to disk before exiting record().
- Changed the 'lvcreate' calls to use Gibibytes instead of Megabytes.
- Switch an-cm to use the common an-cdb.log file.
- Bumped up the apache Timeout to a rather high number to prevent sessions
  closing during large uploads.
- Now cache /etc/hosts from each node and updated 'on_same_network()' to use
  the cached hosts data when local resolution fails. This allows things like
  powering on a node to work without editing the dashboard's local hosts file.
- Modified how reserved RAM for the host is calculated. To ensure that the user
  always sees and even number of GiB, the reserved amount is set to an even
  number of GiB, 3 currently, the modulous is calculated on the available RAM,
  and then the available RAM is calculated as
  (total ram - modulous - reserved).
- When a node's DRBD disk state is 'Inconsistent' and the resync percentage was
  read successfully, the percentage complete is shown.
- Trying to upload a file without defining a file now throws a proper error
  message.
