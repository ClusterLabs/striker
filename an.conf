### Common - These values apply to all utilities.

# This configures how email is sent from this machine. Please be sure to set
# the values below to the values given to you by your mail administrator (if
# that's not you).
#
# This is the mail server to connect to when sending email.
smtp::server			=	mail.example.com

# This is the TCP port used to connect to the mail server.
smtp::port			=	587

# This is the number of seconds to wait for a responce when connection to the
# mail server on the given port that you set above.
smtp::timeout			=	60

# This is the email address/IMAP user to send to the mail server. It is also
# the address used in the "From: " field for emails sent from this machine.
# NOTE: If you IMAP user name is not an email address, this may not work (it
# has not been tested). If you have trouble, please let us know:
# - https://alteeve.ca/w/Support
smtp::username			=	alert@example.com

# This is the password used for the email account above. This can be the
# password directly, or a file that contains the password.
#smtp::password			=	file:./email_pw.txt
smtp::password			=	secret

# This is the security level to use when connecting to the peer, if needed.
smtp::security			=	STARTTLS

# This tells us to use an encrypted connection to the mail server. Set to '0'
# to send email plain-text (not recommended!).
smtp::encrypt_pass		=	1

# This is the domain given to the mail server when establishing the connection.
smtp::helo_domain		=	example.com

# This is a comma-separated list of email recipients. Please use bare email
# addresses only.
mail_data::to			=	you@example.com

# This sets the "sending domain" when sending email. It should match
# smtp::server in most cases.
mail_data::sending_domain	=	example.com

# This is the port to use when connecting to the guacamole server. Normally,
# this is 8080, but may be overridden on a per-Anvil! basis for remote
# access configurations.
guacd::port			=	8080


# This defines the cluster. If you want to defined multiple clusters for
# AN!CDB, copy an entry in this section and increment the variable integer. 
# The order and value do not matter. It's simply a differentiator. If only one
# entry exists, the Dashboard's Anvil! selection screen will not show and the
# sole entry will be auto-selected.

# Variables are:
# name:        Must match the name set in the Anvil!'s "cluster.conf" file. 
# nodes:       A comma-separated list of nodes. On the AN!CDB server, this must
#              be resolvable to the target machine (ie: via /etc/hosts +
#              ~/.ssh/config)
# company:     A free-form field used to show the owner of the Anvil!. 
#              Particularly useful for resellers and companies with divisions.
# description: Also a free-form field used to describe the purpose of the
#              particular Anvil!.
# url:         If defined, a link to the given URL will be shown beside the
#              Anvil!'s name in the Dashboard's Anvil! selection screen. Useful
#              for linking to internal documentation or similar.
# ricci_pw:    This is the password used by the 'ricci' user on the Anvil!'s
#              nodes. It must be set accurately in order to add or remove
#              servers. If a password is needed to log into one of the nodes,
#              this password will be used. If this doesn't work, you will need
#              to manually add the dashboard's public key to each node's root
#              user's 'authorized_keys' file.
# guac::port:  This is used to control which TCP port is used when connecting
#              to the guacamole server (in-browser remote desktop access).
