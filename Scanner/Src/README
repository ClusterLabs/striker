A compiled copy of the ipmi wrapper, wipmi, is provided in the Scanner directory. 

If this does not work on a host, or if the ipmitool is in a different
location, rather thann /usr/bin, a new instance can be compiled from
wipmi.c

Edit wipmi.c to contain the correct path to ipmitool, and then carry
out the following commands.

	gcc -g -o ../wipmi wipmi.c
 	sudo chown root ../wipmi
	sudo chmod 755 ../wipmi
        sudo chmod u+s ../wipmi

The program should then be executable by non-root users to fetch ipmi data.

Similarly for the storcli64 wrapper:

	gcc -g -o ../wstorcli wstorcli.c
 	sudo chown root ../wstorcli
	sudo chmod 755 ../wstorcli
        sudo chmod u+s ../wstorcli
