=head1 NAME

     Alerts.pm - package to handle alerts

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Alerts.pm version 0.0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use AN::Alerts;
    my $scanner = AN::Scanner->new({agents => $agents_data });


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the Alerts handling system. It is intended for a
time-based loop system.  Various subsystems ( packages, subroutines )
report problems of various severity during a single loop. At the end,
a single report email is sent to report all new errors. Errors are
reported once, continued existence of the problem is taken for granted
until the problem goes away. When an alert ceases to be a problem, a
new message is sent, but other problems continue to be monitored.

=head1 METHODS
