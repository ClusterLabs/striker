# This is the mail server to connect to when sending email.

# This is the TCP port used to connect to the mail server.

# This is the email address/IMAP user to send to the mail server. It is also

### Per-#!string!brand_0004!# Configurations

# This defines each #!string!brand_0004!#. If you want to defined multiple #!string!brand_0004!#s in #!string!brand_0002!#,
# copy an entry in this section and increment the variable integer. The order
# and value do not matter. It's simply a differentiator. If only one entry
# exists, #!string!brand_0002!#'s #!string!brand_0004!# selection screen will not show and the sole entry
# will be auto-selected.
#
# name:        Must match the name set in the #!string!brand_0004!#'s 'cluster.conf' file. 
# nodes:       A comma-separated list of nodes. On the #!string!brand_0002!# server, this must
#              be resolvable to the target machine (ie: via /etc/hosts +
#              /etc/ssh/ssh_config)
# company:     A free-form field used to show the owner of the #!string!brand_0004!#. 
#              Particularly useful for resellers and companies with divisions.
# description: Also a free-form field used to describe the purpose of the
#              particular #!string!brand_0004!#.
# url:         If defined, a link to the given URL will be shown beside the
#              #!string!brand_0004!#'s name in the Dashboard's #!string!brand_0004!# selection screen. Useful
#              for linking to internal documentation or similar.
# ricci_pw:    This is the password used by the 'ricci' user on the #!string!brand_0004!#'s
#              nodes. It must be set accurately in order to add or remove
#              servers. If the 'root_pw' is not set below, this password will
#              be used.
# root_pw:     This password is used by the dashboard to log into this #!string!brand_0004!#'s
#              nodes.
