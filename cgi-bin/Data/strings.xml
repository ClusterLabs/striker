### Per-#!string!brand_0004!# Configurations

# This defines each #!string!brand_0004!#. If you want to defined multiple #!string!brand_0004!#s in #!string!brand_0002!#,
# copy an entry in this section and increment the variable integer. The order
# and value do not matter. It's simply a differentiator. If only one entry
# exists, #!string!brand_0002!#'s #!string!brand_0004!# selection screen will not show and the sole entry
# will be auto-selected.
#
# name:        Must match the name set in the #!string!brand_0004!#'s 'cluster.conf' file. 
# nodes:       A comma-separated list of nodes. On the #!string!brand_0002!# server, this must
#              be resolvable to the target machine (ie: via /etc/hosts +
#              /etc/ssh/ssh_config)
# company:     A free-form field used to show the owner of the #!string!brand_0004!#. 
#              Particularly useful for resellers and companies with divisions.
# description: Also a free-form field used to describe the purpose of the
#              particular #!string!brand_0004!#.
# url:         If defined, a link to the given URL will be shown beside the
#              #!string!brand_0004!#'s name in the Dashboard's #!string!brand_0004!# selection screen. Useful
#              for linking to internal documentation or similar.
# ricci_pw:    This is the password used by the 'ricci' user on the #!string!brand_0004!#'s
#              nodes. It must be set accurately in order to add or remove
#              servers. If the 'root_pw' is not set below, this password will
#              be used.
# root_pw:     This password is used by the dashboard to log into this #!string!brand_0004!#'s
#              nodes.

DESCRIPTION

This program sets up passwordless SSH to the nodes associated with the given
'--anvil X' switch. This is designed to allow Virtual Machine Manager the 
ability to access servers on the nodes without repeated request to enter the
nodes' password.

== USE OF THIS FEATURE POSES A SECURITY RISK! ==

Please see the comments in #!data!path::striker_config!# -> tools::striker-push-ssh::enabled.


SWITCHES

 --anvil
 
	This is the name of the #!string!brand_0004!# to use. The associated
	nodes are found by reading #!data!path::striker_config!#.
	
	The nodes are then configured to accept all local users ssh access 
	without a password.
 
 -h, -?, --help

	Show this dialoge and exit.

 -=] #!string!brand_0004!# - #!string!brand_0002!#

DESCRIPTION

This program merges the local #!data!path::striker_config!# with the one on the
named peer dashboard.

Where conflicts exist, the values in the '--prefer [local|peer]' dashboard 
will be used.


SWITCHES

 --peer <hostname or IP>

	This disables the hostname or IP address of the peer dashboard to sync
	with. 

	If --peer and/or --password are not given, the program will try to 
	determine the peer by checking:

	scancore::db::x::host

	If there are two entries and the local host name is found, the other
	will be used as the peer.

 --password
 
	This is the (root) password needed to connect to the peer. 

	If the peer is found in 'scancore::db::x::host' (either via --peer or 
	detected as described above) and --password is not set, the password 
	will be set by:

	scancore::db::x::password

 --prefer [local|peer]

	This controls which node's data will be used if a conflict is detected.
	
	If this is not set, 'local' will be used by default.

 --force

	This will prevent the program from confirming with the user before 
	running. It is needed if the program is run by another program.

DESCRIPTION

This program configures each system user's Virtual Machine Manager instance by
creating or editing ~/.gconf/apps/virt-manager.


SWITCHES

 --enable

	This enables this program by setting:
	
		tools::striker-configure-vmm::enabled = 1
	
	in #!data!path::striker_config!#.
	
	It also adds a link to this program in GDM's PreSession script so that
	it will run as the user logs in, ensuring virt-manager is always 
	configured properly.

 --disable
 
	This disables this program by setting:
	
		tools::striker-configure-vmm::enabled = 0
	
	in #!data!path::striker_config!#.
	
	It also removes the link to this program from GDM's PreSession script.

DESCRIPTION

This program checks to see if it can talk to the peer node on boot. If it can,
it performs a series of sanity checks to make sure everything is healthy. If
all is well, the nodes will start the cluster stack and then servers will be
booted.

Servers that were gracefully shut down, and servers set to never boot, will be
skipped.


SWITCHES


 --abort

	This will cause any running instances of this program to be killed.

 --disable

	Prevent this tool from starting on boot. Be sure to disable it on BOTH
	nodes!

 --enable
 
	Enable this tool on boot. Note that if this is enable on either node,
	the #!string!brand_0004!# will be started.

 --force
 
	Normally, if another instance of this program is already running, this
	instance will immediately exit. Using this switch skips this check and
	forces the instance to run. Be careful using this!

 --state, --status

	Reports whether this tool is enabled on boot or not.

DESCRIPTION

This program shuts down an #!string!brand_0004!# node.

Which node shuts down depends on how it is invoked. If it is invoked with
'--local', the local machine will be shut down *unless* it is the SyncSource
for the peer (it has data on the replicated storage the peer doesn't). In such
a case, the program will throw an error and exit with a non-0 exit code. 

If it is invoked with '--shed-load', then which node shuts down depends on 
several criteria in a certain priority order.

1. Can the peer be reached? If not, load shedding is aborted (as it is assumed
   the peer is already offline, in this context).

2. If one node is the 'SyncSource' for the other, then the Inconsistent peer
   will be shut down.
   
   NOTE: if *both* nodes are SyncSource (on different storage pools), the load
         shed will throw an error and exit with a non-0 exit code.

3. If both nodes are UpToDate, and one node's health is not 'OK', then the sick
   node will be shut down.

4. If both nodes are UpToDate and healthy, the the sum of the RAM used by 
   servers on each node is added. The node with the least amount of RAM used by
   servers will shutdown.
   
5. If the RAM in use by servers on both nodes is the same, node 2 will shut 
   down.

   
In all cases, the node that is shutting down will try to migrate its servers to
the peer. The only exception will be when the peer is also in a 'warning' or
'critical' state (which indicates an external issue, like low UPS batteries or
an overtemperature event). In such a case, the server that is shutting down 
will gracefully shut down servers running on it.


SWITCHES


 --local

	Shut this machine down.

 --reason X

	If set, the string passed in will be set in the stop reason column for
	servers that are shut down. The reason can not contain spaces or 
	non-alpha-numeric characters. The default stop reason is 'clean', or
	'shed-load' if '--shed-load' was used.

 --shed-load

	Picks a node to turn off based on the above criteria.

DESCRIPTION

This takes a command and runs it sometime in the future, redirecting output 
from the call to a temporary file. This is done using a random token given to
the initial caller and then adding itself to crontab. When called again with
that token via crontab, it deletes itself from cron and then executes the
requested command, writing out any output to: '/tmp/token.<token>.txt'.


NOTE

When called without a token, the generated token out command output file will
be printed;

token:  [<string>]
output: [</path/to/file>]

Note that the output should match above, but the parser should handle an 
arbitrary number of spaces between ':' and '['.

The 'output' file will terminate with a single line containing 'sdr-rc:X' where
'X' is the called program's return code.


SWITCHES

 --call '/path/to/call [args]'
 
	This is the command to call. If your command uses single-quotes in the
	argument list, escape them.

 --delay <seconds>

	This is the number of second to delay. Note that it gets rounded up to
	the next even minute, which is crontab's resolution. For example, if 
	this is set to '30' and the time in 10:22:45, the delay will set to 
	10:23:15, then rounded up to 10:24:00.
	
	The primary goal is to ensure that if a command needs to be coordinated
	between machines, assuming the machines are in time sync, they will all
	run at the same time. So the delay acts as a buffer of sorts in case
	the caller is requesting a delay very close to the start of the next 
	minute (ie: it sets the delay at 10:22:59 on one machine and 10:23:01
	on another, they would trigger one minute apart with no delay). 
	
	If you don't care about coordinating actions, you can ignore this and
	the call will happen within one minute.

 --token <string>

	This is the token used for the run. Normally the caller will never set
	this as it is generated automatically and used in the crontab file.

DESCRIPTION

This program is designed to run once per minute from cron. When it runs, it 
looks to see if #!data!path::anvil-jobs!# exists.

If it doesn't, the program exits. If it does, it is read in and parsed. The
format is:

<time>:<token>:'<command {args}>'

The 'time' field is a unix time stamp. If the current time is equal to or 
greater than the time stamp, the command is run. If not, it is left in the
queue for later.

The token is used to track the job and is used to generate the file where the
call's STDOUT is written. Once a job is started, it is removed from the queue.
If no jobs are left, the jobs file is removed.


NOTE

Jobs are queued by AN::Tools::Remote->synchronous_command_run(). This is not
meant to be used by other tools or applications, though there should be no harm
in doing so.


SWITCHES

 --abort <string>

	This will remove the queued job with the matching string (usually the 
	token, but the command could be used as well). Note that if the job has
	already started, it will NOT be cancelled.
