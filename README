AN!CDB - Cluster Dashboard v1.0-rc1

Please note: This is a release candidate of this program.

This program talks to cluster nodes using password-less ssh shared keys. It
presents the user with a view of their current VMs and the remaining free
resources on their cluster. 

This program provides full control of a cluster's VMs and the host nodes. From
it, you can cold boot, cold stop, boot, power off, fence, withdraw from and
join a node to the cluster.

VMs can be booted, migrated, gracefully shutdown and forced off.

This program is designed for use on clusters using Red Hat High Availability 
Add-on, backed by DRBD which is in turn managed by clustered LVM. It is 
specifically designed for clusters built according to the tutorial below:
