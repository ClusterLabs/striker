!!! If you use this before this warning is removed, you will have a bad time.

This program talks to cluster nodes using password-less ssh shared keys. It
presents the user with a view of their current VMs and the remaining free
resources on their cluster. When free resources exist, the user will be able to
use this program to provision new VMs which will then be added to the cluster
management.

This program is designed for use on clusters using Red Hat High Availability 
Add-on, backed by DRBD which is in turn managed by clustered LVM. It is 
specifically designed for clusters built according to the tutorial below:
