REQUIREMENTS

Attempts were made to keep to requirements of third party modules to a minimum. However, a few are needed.

Math::BigInt

  In some cases, like in the AN::Tools::Readable module's 'hr_to_bytes' method,
  this module will be needed. Specifically when a size larger than 1 petabyte/
  pebibyte is passed. This module provides arbitrary size mathmatical functions
  at the cost of speed. This module is only loaded when a big enough number is
  passed in to warrant it.

IO::Handle

  Whenever AN::Tools needs to open a file for reading or writting, or when it
  needs to make a system call, it uses the IO::Handle method to create the
  filehandle. This is a core module and most systems should have it by default.

Fcntl

  When AN::Tools::Log wants to spool off the top of a log file to create space,
  it uses Fcntl's LOCK_EX and LOCK_UN calls. This is a core module and most
  systems should have it by default.
