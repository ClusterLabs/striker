# - This sections sets the core directories, Any directories that are not     #
#   fully qualified will be set relative to 'dir::install' unless             #
#   specifically stated otherwise. Be sure then to change 'dir::install' to   #
#   be the root of your program. At this time, directories are not created on #
#   demand, so please be sure to have created them before running your        #
#   program for the first time.                                               #
#                                                                             #
#   NOTE:                                                                     #
#   To make sure that your program is portable, use a double-colon '::' as    #
#   directory delimeters. AN::Tools will convert these to your operating      #
#   system's directory delimiter on demand. If you use your OS delimiter, it  #
#   will work fine but your program will be less portable. For example, these #
#   two values are equal on POSIX operating systems:                          #
#   - /var/www/alteeve.ca    # Not portable, works on POSIX OS' only.         #
#   - ::var::www::alteeve.ca # Will port to any supported OS but is more      #
#                            # tedious to type.                               #
