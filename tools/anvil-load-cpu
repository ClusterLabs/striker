# Puts all CPUs under high load. Useful for testing ScanCore's thermal shutdown 
# Feature. To test, edit '/etc/striker/striker.conf' and set/add:
# 
#scanner::temperature::shutdown_limit           = 5
#scan-ipmitool::thresholds::CPU1::high_warning  = 45
#scan-ipmitool::thresholds::CPU1::high_critical = 55
#scan-ipmitool::thresholds::CPU1::weight        = 2.6
#scan-ipmitool::thresholds::CPU2::high_warning  = 45
#scan-ipmitool::thresholds::CPU2::high_critical = 55
#scan-ipmitool::thresholds::CPU2::weight        = 2.6
# 
# With ScanCore running, run this program and within a short time a thermal
# shutdown should be triggered.
