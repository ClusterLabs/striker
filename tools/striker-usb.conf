### Overview
# 
# This control how USB mass storage devices will be managed when plugged into
# given physical USB ports. The second field in each section is the USB address
# of the USB port to be managed.
# 
# When a drive is plugged into a managed USB port, it's filesystem(s) will be
# mounted locally. Then striker will log into a target machine over SSH and use
# sshfs to mount the inserted partition(s) on that target machine.
# 
# Requirements:
# 
# Target servers require 'sshfs'.
# 
# To determin the port address, open a terminal and run:
#   tail -f /var/log/messages
# 
# When the USB drive is plugged into a port, you will see a message like:
# 
# ====
# Mar  2 21:23:50 an-striker03 kernel: usb 1-3: new high speed USB device number 7 using ehci_hcd
# Mar  2 21:23:51 an-striker03 kernel: usb 1-3: New USB device found, idVendor=174c, idProduct=55aa

# ====
# 
# The USB address in the above example is "1-3". Knowing this, the variable
# names used below will start with 'usb::1-3::...'. 
# 
# If a mass storage device is plugged into any USB port not specified here,
# striker-usb will simply ignore it.
# 

### Variables
#
# When it's time to mount the local USB drive's mount point on a remote
# machine, we need to pass credentials to the remote machine in order for it
# to connect to this machine.
#
# The host name entered below must be resolvable on the target server. If in
# doubt, use this machine's IP address.
local::host			=	10.255.4.3
local::user			=	root
local::password			=	secret

# It is possible to decrypt LUKS-encrypted partition, provided the LUKS key is
# provided. At this time, only one global LUKS key is supported. Enter it in
# the following variable.
luks::passphrase		=	supersecret

# If the partition is not 'ext4' or if it's not encrypted, setting this to '1'
# will cause the drive to be reformatted and encrypted without prompt. This
# should only be enabled in very specific circumstances. If used, be sure to
# warn users that their drives will be reformatted if they plug them into a
# managed port and they are not encrupted!
luks::force_initialize		=	1

# This tells us what file system to create on the decrypted device mapper
# device after we created the LUKS encrypted partition.
luks::use_filesystem		=	ext4

# Set this below if you want to define a specific label when formatting a newly
# encrypted device with the filesystem set above. If your selected filesystem
# doesn't support labels, leave this blank.
luks::fs_label			=	nc0
luks::fs_options		=	-L #!variable!fs_label!# 

# If the 'force_initialize' option is enabled, you can use this option to
# selectively block the forced reformatting based on the label of the drive.
# This can be a static name or a basic regular expression. If the value ends
# in '*', then a label will be considered a match if the start of the string
# matches the value to the left of the '*' here. The string *is* case 
# sensitive.
luks::protected_label		=	c*


# Local directory to mount the inserted device on. If the specified directory
# does exit, it will be created. If multiple partitions exist on the inserted
# USB drive, the first partition will mount with the given name and each
# subsequent partition will have '-X' added to the mount directory, where X is
# an integer starting at '1'.
#
#usb::X-Y::local_mount
#
# This is the host name or IP address that the remote machine.
# 
#usb::X-Y::sshfs::host
# 
# This is the user name and password used when ssh'ing into the remote machine.
# 
#usb::X-Y::sshfs::user
#usb::X-Y::sshfs::password
#
# This is the directory to mount point to use on the remote machine
#
#usb::X-Y::sshfs::remote_mount	=	/media/an-striker03-1-1
# 

### Examples
#
# Note: In this example, the server's host name is 'an-striker03'.

# Front panel, furthest left.
